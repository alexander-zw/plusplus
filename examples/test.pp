It was an eight-hour drive from New York to Bar Harbor, Maine. Sleet and snow pounded the
highway. Annabeth, Thalia, and I hadn't seen each other in months, but between the blizzard and the
thought of what we were about to do, we were too nervous to talk much. Except for my mom.  She talks
more when she's nervous. By the time we finally got to Westover Hall, it was getting dark, and she'd told
Annabeth and Thalia every embarrassing baby story there was to tell about me.
