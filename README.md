# The ++ Programming Language

The ++ (PlusPlus) programming language, a language where all keywords are
symbols, based on JavaScript. This Repo contains a compiler written in Rust that
translates ++ into JavaScript.

The current compiler has some limitations: semicolons and braces are required,
at the end of a statement and to denote a branch or loop block respectively.
